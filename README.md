# WebView

This is a Java port of the fantastic, tiny, light-weight [WebView](https://github.com/zserge/webview) by [Serge Zaitsev](https://zserge.com).

It is packaged into an executable Jar file so that you can run it as a CLI self-contained process or as a Java library inside your current process.

## Running in Separate Process


You can run the WebView in a separate process by running:

~~~~
$ java -jar WebView.jar http://www.example.com
~~~~

This will open the web browser in its own window pointing to http://www.example.com.

### Interacting with the Browser Environment

You can interact with the browser environment by typing into the console while the browser is running.  The browser listens on STDIN, for any input, and it will evaluate any input as Javascript in the context of the current page.  E.g. Type "alert('foo')" then `[ENTER]` to open an alert popup.  

If you need to enter a multi-line Javascript command, then begin your input with `<<<SOME_BOUNDARY`, and end it with `SOME_BOUNDARY`.

For example:

~~~~
<<<END
var url = window.location.href;
alert('You are at '+url);
END
~~~~

NOTE:  If you give it an empty boundary, then it will simply use a blank line as your boundary.

### Getting Information From The Browser

There are two ways get the browser to communicate back to the outside world:

1. The onLoad callback.  Whenever the user nagivates to a new page, it will output `loaded [URL]` to STDOUT.  E.g. If you navigate to google.com, then it will output `loaded https://google.com` to STDOUT.
2. Call `window.external.invoke("some message")`.  This will cause the browser print "some message" to STDOUT.  All messages of this kind are wrapped with beginning and ending boundaries to make the output easier to parse, in case you are writing a program to interact with the browser.

Here is an example of a session, where I load google.com, and then get its page title via `window.external.invoke()`:

~~~~
$ java -jar WebView-shaded.jar "https://www.google.com"

loaded https://www.google.com/
window.external.invoke(document.title)
<<<Boundary1575660241187
Google
Boundary1575660241187
~~~~

A few things to notice here:

1. When the page is loaded, it informed us with "loaded https://www.google.com" in STDOUT
2. I typed the "window.external.invoke(document.title)" command.
3. It responded to my command with an open boundary `<<<Boundary1575660241187` followed by the message ("Google"), followed by the closing boundary `Boundary1575660241187`

## Using Java API

If you want to use the webview directly in your Java app, you can do this also. 

A simple usage example:

~~~~
webview = new WebView()
    .size(width, height)
    .title(title)
    .resizable(resizable)
    .fullscreen(fullscreen)
    .url(u)
    .onLoad(()->{
       //.. Do something on page load.
	   // You can get the url of the page via webview.url()
    })
    .javascriptCallback(message->{
        // Handle a message sent via window.external.invoke(message)
        // message is a string.
    })
    .show();
~~~~

NOTE: The `show()` method will start a blocking event loop.

WARNING: Currently the WebView is picky about being started on the main application thread.  On Mac you may need to add the "-XstartOnFirstThread" flag in the JVM.

## Using Java API from Swing, JavaFX, or other UI Toolkit

The WebView class cannot be used from Swing, JavaFX, or any other existing UI toolkit because it starts its own event loop.  If you want to make use of the WebView from within such an app, you'll need to use the WebViewCLIClient class, which provides an interface to create and manage a WebView which runs inside its own subprocess.

See the [Swing Demo](demos/WebViewSwingDemo/README.md) for a full example of this.

The basics are:

~~~~

// Opening the webview
WebViewCLIClient webview = (WebViewCLIClient)new WebViewCLIClient.Builder()
    .url("https://www.codenameone.com")
    .title("Codename One")
    .size(800, 600)
    .build();
    
// Adding a load listener (fired whenever a page loads)
webview.addLoadListener(evt->{
    System.out.println("Loaded "+evt.getURL());
});

// Adding a message listener (fired whenever any js calls window.postMessageExt(msg))
webview.addMessageListener(evt->{
    System.out.println(evt.getMessage());
});

// Evaluate javascript on the current page.  Implicit callback() method
// allows you to return result in CompetableFuture.
webview.eval("callback(window.location.href)")
    .thenAccept(str->{
        System.out.println("Current URL is "+str);
    });
    
    

    
// Closing the webview later
webview.close();
~~~~


    


#### Demos

1. [Swing Demo](demos/WebViewSwingDemo/README.md) - A simple demo showing how to create and control a WebView from a Swing App.
2. [Minimal Demo](demos/WebViewMinimalDemo/README.md) - A simple demo that only launches a WebView on the main thread.

## Supported Platforms

This should work on Mac, Linux, and Windows.


## Building Sources

~~~
git clone https://github.com/shannah/webviewjar
cd webviewjar
ant jar
~~~

This will create dist/WebView.jar, which can be run as an executable jar.

### Troubleshooting

ANT requires that the `platforms.JDK_1.8.home` system property is set to your JAVA_HOME.  If it complains about this, you can fix the issue by changing the `ant jar` command, above, to `ant jar -Dplatforms.JDK_1.8.home="$JAVA_HOME"`.

### Rebuilding Native Libs

The repo comes with pre-built native libs in the src/windows_32, src/windows_64, src/osx_64, and src/linux_64.  If you want to make changes to these native libs, then the following information may be of use to you.

1. Use the `build-xxx.sh` (where xxx is your current platform) scripts to rebuild the native sources, and copy them into the appropriate place in the src directory.
2. Mac and linux native sources are located in the src_c directory.  Windows native sources are in the windows directory.
3. On Windows, you'll need to have Visual Studio installed (I use VS 2019, but earlier versions probably work).  Additionally, I use git bash on Windows, which is why the build-windows.sh is a bash script, and not a .bat script.
