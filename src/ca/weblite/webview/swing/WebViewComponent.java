/**
 * Base class for Swing components that host a native WebView.
 *
 * <p>Most callers don't need to think about heavyweight vs lightweight --
 * use the {@link #create()} factory and the right mode for the current
 * platform is picked for you (heavyweight on macOS / Windows, lightweight
 * on Linux).  Override with the {@code ca.weblite.webview.mode} system
 * property if you need a specific mode.
 *
 * <p>Two concrete implementations are provided:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link WebViewHeavyweightComponent} -- the native WebView is embedded
 *       as a child of a heavyweight AWT peer and renders directly over the
 *       Swing hierarchy.  Highest fidelity and best performance, but
 *       interacts with the Z-order in the usual heavyweight-vs-lightweight
 *       manner (it will paint over any Swing components occupying the same
 *       region).</li>
 *   <li>{@link WebViewLightweightComponent} -- the native WebView is rendered
 *       into an off-screen buffer and the pixels are drawn into the Swing
 *       component using {@code Graphics2D}.  Composites cleanly with the
 *       rest of the Swing hierarchy at the cost of additional copy overhead
 *       and the need to forward Swing input events back into the native
 *       engine.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Configuration methods (URL, init scripts, bindings) may be called at any
 * time; pending configuration is applied as soon as the component becomes
 * displayable.  After that, the same methods take effect immediately on the
 * underlying native WebView.
