# Build the macOS native library for the HOST architecture (Canvas 8, Op 8).
#
# Note: JAWT is deliberately NOT linked. The JAWT_* symbols are left undefined
# at link time (-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup) and resolve at load time against
# the libjawt that WebViewNative pre-loads before this library (the two-phase
# preload). Linking -ljawt would make the build depend on a standalone libjawt
# that some JDKs do not ship -- exactly the case the loader is written to
# survive -- and fails with "ld: library 'jawt' not found" on a stock JDK.
# This mirrors the macOS `native` job in .github/workflows/build.yml, which
# produces the artifact that actually ships.
